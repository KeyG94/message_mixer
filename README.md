A program I made to play around different JavaScript methods that manipulates and displays text in different ways.

.split(" ") "takes a string and splits it for every character thats fed to the built in method and returns it as an array".
.reverse() "reverses the order of the content".
.toUpperCase() "changes all characters to UPPER CASE - VERY USEFUL FOR EMAIL or TEXT INPUT COMPARISSON THAT ARE NON CASE SeNsEtIvE".
.toLowerCase() "changes all characters to lower case - very useful.... --||--".
.join() "joins/returns an array of content to one string, if value is entered content can be seperated with for example a comma".
.replace() "takes two arguments, content that looks like "this" will be replaced with this: .replace(toBeReplaced, replaceWith)".

Also experimented with import and export.
